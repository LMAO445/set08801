        The most tv shows and movies which are so succeessful come from korea. Japan is also popular about with its deatil and shooting skill but korea have more hit movies and shows than japan. Hollywood nailed when it come 
        to sci-fi and psychology movie. Those knid of movies and shows form korea have a huge fandom but Hollywood can direct that hard to undersatnd. Movies like TENET. The driector even said that movie was not supposed to undersatnd.
        Audience need to wwatch it twice or more to realize what happening in that movie. A shows called DARK which is not from Hollywood was a bit complicate but has a huge communinity because of its complec time travel storyline. when I say
        time travel that does not mean that is like "Back To Future". Show has a dark theme and scare people off even it is not a horror shows.

        But action movie and shows from korea is different. Men in our country or who don't know korean movie and shows, they know one person and it is ma dong seok. His move are "Round Up" "The Ganster, The Cop, The Devil". They way he puch,
        his strengh and the auido affect used in his Outlaw franchise is different. You will hear ribs breking or bone crack noise throughout his movies. Korean used boxing style in every movies and shows. That is why it is differnt from Hollywood.
        But sometime it went side-way when actor does not know about boxing or take boxing class. We can't understimate VFX or CGI in kora movie and shows. They are catching up with Hollywood and you will know if you watched Tryant or The Witch.
